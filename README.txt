App Description:
    Our app is an image guessing game where a player can guess which of the four images shown will be randomly selected by
    the program. If the player is correct, their balance (which is their score) will be incremented by 1, but if they're
    incorrect their balance will stay the same. The login information and balances of each player will be stored in MongoDB.
